<p>Ever since I first touched a computer keyboard in the early 1980's, I have loved programming. A few years ago, however, I started to burn out. Somehow, building web sites (yes, everything has to be on the web nowadays) just didn't carry the same excitement that I used to feel when programming. Recently, I found a new passion. It isn't really new&mdash;I have always loved optimization problems&mdash;I just discovered what other people called it, and was able to learn a lot more about it.  This "new" passion is called "Data Science," and it is <i>A Fun Thing</i>&trade;.
