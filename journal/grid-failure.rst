Grid Failure
============

Yesterday and today the power grid in Tremonton failed several times, leaving much of the city without electricity.
The more this happens, the more we think about alternative sources.
While becoming completely independent of the grid would require a significant investment -- one that I am unwilling to make right now -- there are many things that can be done.

  1.  flashlights with rechargable batteries. at least one per person would be good
  2.  battery backup for the internet
      a local outage should not cut off communications, especially when we decide to ditch the land line. 
      (We might want a cell phone for emergencies. I believe most cell towers have battery power)

In a new house, I will:

  3.  install LED light strips in every room.
  4.  replace upright refrigerator with a chest fridge with a DC motor connected to a battery with a solar panel
  5.  use a rocket mass heater for warmth. This will work without electricity, and can be used for cooking in a pinch.
      If we decide to use a fan for drawing the smoke before the heater warms up, this would have a DC motor.
      
      
As we are reminded by the events in 3 Nephi 3+, the most important preparation is spiritual. Elder Christofferson reminds us "In times of crisis, let your covenants be paramount, and your obedience exact."  Therein lies the only true safety and peace.
