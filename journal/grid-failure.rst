Grid Failure
============

Yesterday and today the power grid in Tremonton failed several times, leaving much of the city without electricity.
The more this happens, the more we think about alternative sources.
While becoming completely independent of the grid would require a significant investment -- one that I am unable to make right now -- there are many things that can be done.

  1.  flashlights with rechargable batteries. at least one per person would be good
  2.  battery backup for the internet
      a local outage should not cut off communications, especially when we decide to ditch the land line. 
      (We might want a cell phone for emergencies. I believe most cell towers have battery power)

In a new house, I will:

  3.  install LED lighting (DC) in every room.
  4.  replace upright refrigerator with a chest fridge with a DC motor connected to a battery with a solar panel
  5.  use a rocket mass heater for warmth. This will work without electricity, and can be used for cooking in a pinch.
      If we decide to use a fan for drawing the smoke before the heater warms up, this would have a DC motor.
      
      
We are reminded by the events in 3 Nephi 3+ that the most important preparation is spiritual. 
Elder Christofferson reminds us "In times of distress, let your covenants be paramount and let your obedience be exact."  
Therein lies the only true safety and peace.

But we are not meant to be "safe" -- not yet.
A large rock at the bottom of a hill is "safe," but it doesn't *do* anything.
"...we enjoy a continual flow of blessings promised by God in His covenant with us. 
Those blessings provide *the resources we need to act rather than simply be acted upon* as we go through life."
We are meant to act.
Every blessing God gives us is to increase our ability to exercise our agency. 
(Maybe not *every* blessing: Many of them are simply enjoyable.)

Hidden Treasures
----------------
'the Lord’s commandments in the Word of Wisdom regarding the care of our physical bodies bless us *first and foremost* with “wisdom and great treasures of knowledge, even hidden treasures”'
I have missed the point of this law. 
The hidden treasures of knowledge are *first and foremost*  
The physical health benefits are secondary.
It is called a word of *wisdom*.
For God, healing a physical body and restoring it to its perfect and proper frame is trivial. 
(See Helaman 12 https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng)
Helping His children gain the wisdom that He has for them is the work of eternity.
