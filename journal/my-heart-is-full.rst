My Heart is full
===========
Joseph enjoyed his prom yesterday.

Today is the first day of our Health Challenge at work.
I slept for 8 hours.
I brushed my teeth at least 4 times
I tracked everything I ate.
I ate a Skittle that Lily Topham shared with me, so I don't get the point for no sweets.
I listened to at least 8 different podcasts (conference talks/byu devotional speeches)
I didn't drink very much water.
I read scriptures (self help book) with my family for 20 minutes
I am going to read for 15 minutes more before I go to bed.

There is so much that God wants to give us and teach us, if only we are willing to learn. I am reminded of the "hen gathering her chicks" simile in 3 Nephi 8-10.
