Big Hero 6
==========

The PTA sponsored a movie night at the elementary school. The movie was Big Hero 6. I could wish for less violence and better music, but the story was good, and there were enough geek cultural references to keep one busy for a long time.  I have always identified myself with geekdom, but watching this movie (and understanding it!) confirmed this association. Only with long and deep immersion in a culture can one truly appriciate it.

It is an interesting coincidence that I first watched this movie on the same day that Leonard Nimoy died. He is dead, but he will always be with us as long as we remember him. I feel for the people who believe that death is the end, that we only live on in the memories of our loved ones. As Abigail passed into the wormhole and didn't come out, her father saw that as her death -- the end.  When Hero and Baymax went in, they saw that it was not the end, but in fact a beautiful and different world.  Whatever life will be like after death, it is definitely not the end.  I am not in a hurry to die, but I do not fear death.

Baymax must have had some amazing sensors to be able to see through all of the noise of that portal. Dr. McCoy would have traded a thousand tricorders for that tech.
