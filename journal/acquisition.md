Alex Vermeer has a list of what he calls “tangibles.”  He maintains a list because he wants to be conscious of the stuff to which he has attached himself. He does not intend to get rid of anything important or valuable. “Books don't count” he says. I guess the list would get too long too fast. His stated goal is to keep the list to about 150 items.

I like the idea of a catalog to keep things simple. I like even more the idea of having a definite strategy for each acquisition. When you are about to acquire something, answer these questions and record the answers.

  1. Why do I want this? Think very deeply about this. Get to the root motivation, not just the superficial justification.
  2. What costs are associated with acquiring it?
  3. What costs are associated with storing and maintaining it?
  4. What else could I do with resources I might use to acquire and maintain it?
  5. What value does it bring to my life?
  6. How do I plan to use it? (e.g. How often? What types of activities will it support? What value will it add to these activities?)
  7. What do I already have that can meet these uses or add this value?
  8. What alternatives are there to ownership? Can I borrow or rent this item and be free of it when I am done?
  9. What is my “exit strategy”? That is: When and how do I plan to get rid of it when it is no longer useful, takes up too much space in my home or my brain, costs too much to maintain, breaks beyond repair, wears out, etc.
  10. How often will I reevaluate the utility or value of this item?

As you periodically review your life, look at your list and annotate your expectations with your experience. How did it work out after all? Was it worth it? This feedback will inform future decisions.  Even without a specific-#-of-items goal, you will soon get very good at keeping junk out of your life, and getting more value out of what you do allow in. 

I believe these questions are valid even for books (How many times will I read this? To whom will I give it when I am done?) and food (Exit strategy is “eating,” but what happens to it after you eat it? How will you burn those extra calories?) and especially for kitchen gadgets (How often will I use this lime juicer?)
