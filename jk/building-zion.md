# Building Zion

We cannot build Zion vicariously. 
We must each participate personally.
We build it one act of service, one relationship, one testimony, one conversion at time.
It is a long, long way to walk, but it will be worth every mile, because it will last forever.
That's where we'll find Jesus.
