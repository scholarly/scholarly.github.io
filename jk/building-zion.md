# Building Zion

We cannot build Zion vicariously. 
We must each participate personally.
We build it one act of service, one relationship, one testimony, one conversion at time.
[It is a long, long way to walk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMfHeLdpnJw), but it will be worth every mile, because it will last forever.
That's where we'll find Jesus.


At a home teaching visit, I was reminded about the parable of the ten virgins.

  The wise virgins could not share their oil with the foolish virgins because “the oil of spiritual preparedness cannot be shared” (`Marvin J. Ashton, “[A Time of Urgency](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1974/04/a-time-of-urgency?lang=eng),” *Ensign*, May 1974, 36).
  
  “Attendance at sacrament meetings adds oil to our lamps, drop by drop over the years. Fasting, family prayer, home teaching, control of bodily appetites, preaching the gospel, studying the scriptures—each act of dedication and obedience is a drop added to our store. Deeds of kindness, payment of offerings and tithes, chaste thoughts and actions, marriage in the covenant for eternity—these, too, contribute importantly to the oil with which we can at midnight refuel our exhausted lamps.”
  
  President Spencer W. Kimball (1895–1985), *Faith Precedes the Miracle* (1972), 256.
(Quoted in "[The Parable of the Ten Virgins](https://www.lds.org/liahona/2009/03/the-parable-of-the-ten-virgins?lang=eng)" *Liahona*, March 2009)

The following are a few who have explained this over many years:

 * Elder David A. Bednar [Converted unto the Lord](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2012/10/converted-unto-the-lord?lang=eng) October 2012
 * Dallin H. Oaks [Preparation for the Second Coming](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2004/04/preparation-for-the-second-coming?lang=eng) April 2004
 * Bernard P. Brockbank [Entrance into the Kingdom of God](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1972/10/entrance-into-the-kingdom-of-god?lang=eng) October 1972

We cannot say that we have not been warned. I cannot help but think of our own situation as being very similar to that of the Nephites in the final chapters of the Book of Helaman.
