You must, because you said &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, JoyLynn has responded, &amp;quot;Yes, I do have a mouse in my pocket. He helps me keep track of my marbles, so I don't lose them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight, after she put on her pajamas, which don't have pockets, she said &amp;quot;Yes, my mouse is in my invisible pocket with my marbles.&amp;quot;  Then she starts imagining a sales pitch for someone trying to sell invisible pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, she told me about a creature she invented called a quadropus. It is like an octopus, but with four tentacles and four eyes evenly spaced aroud its head. I showed her a picture of Octocat, the GitHub mascot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love her creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
